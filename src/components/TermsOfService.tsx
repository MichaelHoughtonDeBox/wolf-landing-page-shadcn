By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you should not use our Services.

        {/* Description of Services */}
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">3. Description of Services</h2>
        <p>
          Wolf provides a platform for users to report suspicious activity, incidents, or safety concerns via text messages, voice notes, or location sharing. These reports can be used to notify authorities or relevant third parties (e.g., private security) for prompt action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wolf is not an emergency response service, and users should always contact emergency services directly in critical situations. Wolf does not guarantee a specific response time or that reported incidents will always be addressed.
        </p>
