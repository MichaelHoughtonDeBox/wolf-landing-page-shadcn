                Wolf is envisioned as an innovative safety tool that combines the strengths of response software and smart routing logic to provide a unified solution distributed through WhatsApp. By leveraging WhatsApp's widespread usage, Wolf enables users to send messages and voice notes reporting suspicious behaviour or incident witness statements. Utilising sophisticated machine learning technologies, Wolf focuses on prevention and avoidance, analysing data to predict and mitigate potential threats before they escalate, as well as coordinating responses after incidents occur.
